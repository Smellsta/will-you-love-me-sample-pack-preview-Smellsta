      <div class="description">i really knew what, thinking about the lead (is the main sound called the lead? think so) and i dont remember but that piano is what i needed for the vibe for the backround without it its different. im looking at the FX (effects) of what i did to this sample. it has reverb, echo, and scretched. uhm it needs adjustment cuz it bleeds to right... works for now but yeah pretty cool AND FITTING sample here. (pay me you son of a) also i just remember this sample doesnt fully sounds like a hai! its a yaih or some shit im not gonna bother here. i did a really good job tho check it out on samplefocus searching "yay japanese" i think its the second one.</div>
